## Description
Ajax interacts with the webserver whenever a keystroke is entered and outputs relevant information to the browser.
After each matching word is found, it is added to a list of words that have been matched, outputs it to the client,
and clears the input field on the client. Once 3 words are found, AJAX redirects the client to the success page.
